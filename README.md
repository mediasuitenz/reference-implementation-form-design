This project contains reference implementations of the form elements provided by https://github.com/mediasuitenz/mediasuite-form-elements Ember add-on.
This add-on makes small changes and adds some helper methods on top of Dockyard's https://github.com/DockYard/ember-one-way-controls, so look there for
more information if you're stuck.

**Warning:** This reference implementation is far from complete.
